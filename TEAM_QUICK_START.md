# Team Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (3 steps)

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd peerly-app
npm install
```

### 2. Create Environment File
Create `.env.local` with these credentials (get them from Hamza):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://sebscmgcuosemsztmsoq.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[get from Hamza]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[get from Hamza]
GEMINI_API_KEY=[get from Hamza]
```

### 3. Start Building
```bash
# Import Supabase client
import { supabase } from './lib/supabase.ts'

# Start your React Native/Expo project
```

## âœ… That's It!

Your team is now connected to Supabase and ready to start building the React Native app.

## âœ… Current Status:
- âœ… **Database Schema Applied** - All tables created and ready
- âœ… **Authentication Working** - Ready for user signup/login
- âœ… **Connection Tested** - Supabase is fully operational
- âœ… **Environment Configured** - All credentials set up

## Important Notes:
- âœ… `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore` (secrets are safe)
- âœ… All Supabase client code is ready in `lib/supabase.ts`
- âœ… Database schema is applied and working
- âœ… Team can start building immediately

## Next Steps:
1. Start your React Native/Expo project
2. Import `supabase` from `./lib/supabase.ts`
3. Begin building your app components!
